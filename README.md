## Local development

See `.env.development` for Bazaar mock server configuration variables.

## Offline development

Trying to get the assets generated by the Vite dev server to work offline seems a fools errand. Instead, build for production and serve the `dist` files locally. Then, in Chrome dev tools, under Network, set to Offline. It's necessary to build after each change of course.

```bash
npx vite build
```

Using the [`http-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) NPM package with the following `--proxy` option enables history `pushstate` for clean URLs in single page applications. Otherwise, all URLs, apart from the home page will 404. In the `dist` dir, run:

```bash
npx http-server --proxy http://localhost:8080\?
```

## Vue 3 default README

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

If the standalone TypeScript plugin doesn't feel fast enough to you, Volar has also implemented a [Take Over Mode](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471#discussioncomment-1361669) that is more performant. You can enable it by the following steps:

1. Disable the built-in TypeScript Extension
    1) Run `Extensions: Show Built-in Extensions` from VSCode's command palette
    2) Find `TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features`, right click and select `Disable (Workspace)`
2. Reload the VSCode window by running `Developer: Reload Window` from the command palette.

## Customize configuration
